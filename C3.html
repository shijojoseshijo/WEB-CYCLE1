        <p class="p1">Artificial Intelligence is a field of computer science that focuses on creating systems and algorithms that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence, such as problem-solving, learning, and decision-making.
            It encompasses various subfields, including machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision, and has applications in diverse industries, from healthcare to finance.</p>
        <p class="p2">Machine learning is a subset of AI that involves training algorithms to recognize patterns and make predictions or decisions based on data.
            It is the technology behind recommendation systems, fraud detection, and autonomous vehicles, and it relies on mathematical and statistical models to improve its performance over time through continuous learning.</p>
        <p class="p3">Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to model and solve complex problems.
            These networks, inspired by the structure of the human brain, consist of interconnected layers of nodes that process and transform data. Deep learning has revolutionized areas like image and speech recognition, leading to breakthroughs in areas such as autonomous driving and medical diagnostics.</p>
